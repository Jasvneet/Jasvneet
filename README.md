### About Me
***

Hello there! I'm Jasvneet, a passionate software engineer with a background in biology. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Biology from UCLA, where I built a solid foundation in analytical thinking, problem-solving, and attention to detail. These skills have seamlessly transitioned into my software engineering career, where I thrive on tackling complex challenges and finding innovative solutions. I have experience in full-stack development, designing intuitive user interfaces, and building backend systems. With each project, I strive to create clean, efficient, and scalable code while adhering to industry best practices. 

I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working with diverse teams to bring ideas to life. I believe in the power of technology to make a positive impact on our world, and I'm excited to be part of the ongoing digital transformation. 


I'm thrilled to continue my journey as a software engineer, leveraging my biology background to bring a unique perspective to the world of technology. If you're interested in collaboration, have any questions, or simply want to connect, feel free to reach out! Let's build something amazing together.
